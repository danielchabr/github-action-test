## Couple rules

- if you're still doing significant changes, mark the PR with ðŸš§ or WIP in the title
- once you request a review, all subsequent changes should be made as new commits. It's fine to force push after a rebase
- even if one approval was given, all comments should have some kind of a resolution before merging
